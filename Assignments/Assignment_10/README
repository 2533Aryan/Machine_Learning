- This project is a machine learning-based approach to sentiment analysis on tweets. 
- The goal of the project is to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on their content. 
- The project uses the Python programming language and various machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy to preprocess, tokenize, vectorize, and classify tweets. 
- The model is trained on a large dataset of tweets and achieves a high accuracy score of over 94%. 
- The project can be useful for various applications such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and brand reputation management.
